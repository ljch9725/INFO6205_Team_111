## Introduction

In computer science and operations research, a genetic al- gorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolu- tionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. The goal of the project is to look into a Paramecium(graphic) Genetic prob- lem analogy and find the best solution to the problem.


## Background

In this case, we are aiming at applying Genetic algorithm to find the best genotype. We should select the best non-mu- tation genotype from the original population at first. Then use the most “longevity” individual in the original popula- tion as the starting pattern of the evolution with gene muta- tion. Do the evolution process in the same nature environ- ment (i.e the same evolution method and termination algo- rithm) can find the best genotype and do the same process recursively.
