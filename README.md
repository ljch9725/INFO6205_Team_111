## Introduction

In this project, we are aiming at applying Genetic algorithm to find the best genotype. We should select the best non-mutation geno- type from the original population at first. Then use the most “longevity” individual in the original population as the starting pat- tern of the evolution with gene mutation. Do the evolution process in the same nature environment (i.e the same evolution method and termination algorithm) can find the best genotype and do the same process recursively.
